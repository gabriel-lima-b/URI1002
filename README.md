This repository contains my solution to [URI's problem 1002: Area of a Circle](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt/problems/view/1002).

The problem itself is very simple, I should just calculate the area of a circle, but I used it to practice some new ~~to me~~ technologies.

The technologies that I wanted to practice were Object Oriented Programming, JUnit, Maven and work with the [BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html) class.
